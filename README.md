## Database

You'll find a backed-up database, in the Database folder, at the root of the pShop project. To import that database, select the pshop.sql file. 

In that DB, there is a user account and an admin account. Here's the usernames and passwords:

- User 1: username="user", password="user"

You have to enter those usernames and passwords, without the "".
